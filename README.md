OSS-In-the-Classroom
====================

Class materials for offering an Open Source Development course -- completely free and transparent


# Background

Software applications, or more commonly known as “apps”, have become ubiquitous with an ever increasing impact on society. Fueling the accelerated growth of desktop, mobile, and web based apps can be largely attributed to greater leverage of Open Source Software (OSS), which is going through its own present renaissance. To be part of the modern era one must fully understand and be able to contribute to software in the open source way.  


#Development Status

We are version 0.1. 
An alpha version of the course was offered [Fall 2014 @ Chapman University] (https://github.com/ChapmanCPSC370/)
